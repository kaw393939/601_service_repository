    # Ignore the specific DeprecationWarning from passlib.utils about the 'crypt' module.
    # This warning originates within the passlib library itself and indicates that
    # 'crypt' is deprecated in Python and will be removed in 3.13.
    # Suppressing it cleans up test output until passlib addresses it internally.
